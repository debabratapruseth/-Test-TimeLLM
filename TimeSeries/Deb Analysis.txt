(A) Problem Statement – Minute-level volatility / Macro Volatility / Intraday

Volatility: variability of price over next hour

Volatility Type: Realized volatility (RV)

Dataset: OHLCV candles – timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume

Best Architecture:

Traditional – Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Bayesian Ridge, Huber Regressor, Naive Past-H RV
Additional - GARCH or EGARCH 

ML – Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, HistGradientBoosting, Gaussian Process
Additional - XGBoost / LightGBM

DL – MLP, DeepLSTM
Additional - TFT / N-Beats

LLM based – TimeLLM (BERT) XX, Chronos-2(Amazon), TimesfM(Google)


(B) Problem Statement – Micro Volatility (HFT)

Volatility: At ms scale, “volatility” is mostly about microprice movement and order-book dynamics, not smooth return variance.

Volatility Type:
	•	Short-horizon realized variance
	•	Quantile risk / tail probability

Dataset: Tick Level Data
	•	Trades stream (every trade event)
	•	Level 2 order book (best bid/ask + depth), or full book updates if you can handle it

Best Architecture: Latency Focused

Traditional – EWMA on midprice returns
ML – Gradient boosting on engineered microstructure features
DL – DeepLOB-style CNN / State Space Models (S4/Mamba-like) / GBDT
LLM based – NOT RECOMMENDED
